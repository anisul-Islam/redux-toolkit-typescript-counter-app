# redux-toolkit

- step 1: create the UI
- step 2: install `npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux @types/react-redux`

- step 3: createSlice (which handles the logic)
- step 4: create store / configureStore (it needs to know the reducer which is responsible for updating the states)
- step 5: provide the store
- step 6: use the store with useSelector()
- step 7: dispatch an action with useDispatch()
